# Overview

The purpose of this project was to better familiarize myself with programming using classes in C#. This paint canvas app uses object oriented programming to handle the various interactions expected by the user, such as chnaging brush size and color. I separated the code into three main files, one for the main form and buttons, one for the drawing tool, and another for customization.
